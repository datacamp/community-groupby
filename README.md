# community-groupby
This repository contains notebook + code for DataCamp community post on groupbys, split-apply-combine and pandas.

## Getting set up

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/datacamp/community-groupby
```

If you do not already have the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), go get it (n.b., you can also do this w/out Anaconda using `pip` to install the required packages, however Anaconda is great for Data Science and I encourage you to use it).

Navigate to the relevant directory `community-groupby` and install required packages in a new conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a new environment called group-by-pandas-netflix. To activate the environment, execute

```
source activate group-by-pandas-netflix
```

Then open the notebook `hurricanevis-code.ipynb` and execute the code.
